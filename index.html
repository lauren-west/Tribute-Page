            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Margaret Higgins was born in 1883 in the small factory town of Corning, New York. She was the sixth of
                eleven children, and her mother died of tuberculosis at 48 years-old. According to historian David
                Kennedy, who wrote a detailed account of Margaret Sanger’s life and legacy, Margaret “noted the
                disparity in her parents’ life-spans with bitterness.” Margaret largely blamed her father for her
                mother’s death, allegedly confronting her father saying “You caused this. Mother is dead from having too
                many children." The suffering of women bearing more children than they can physically support is
                something Sanger became familiar with as a child.</p>
            <h2>A Woman Rebel</h2>
            <p>Embracing socialism and an anarchist strategy of direct action, Sanger illegally published her own
                newspaper titled Woman Rebel in 1914. Woman Rebel violated “Section 211 of the Criminal Code of the
                United States,” or colloquially, the Comstock laws of the early nineteenth-century against distributing
                “obscene, lewd, or lascivious” articles. Acknowledging her early radicalism and unfocused emotionalism,
                Sanger said, “They tell me that The Woman Rebel was badly written; that it was crude; that it was
                emotional and hysterical; that it mixed issues; that it was defiant, and too radical. Well, to all of
                these indictments I plead guilty.” Sanger waited to distribute her birth control education pamphlet,
                “Family Limitation,” until she was well out of the country and the scope of the law. In Brixton, Sanger
                revolutionized her approach to birth control advocacy after meeting prominent English sex-psychologist
                Havelock Ellis in December of 1914.</p>
            <h2>Sanger’s “magic pill”</h2>
            <p>By the 1940s, birth control was common knowledge and widely used thanks to birth control trailblazers,
                especially Margaret Sanger. Sanger had long dreamed of birth control in the form of a simple pill. With
                the help of scientists Gregory Goodwin Pincus and John Rock and funding from fellow advocate Katherine
                McCormick, Sanger's dream culminated in the invention of Enovid, the first contraceptive pill that
                became FDA approved in 1960. "The Pill" allowed women to pursue a life outside of the home, ending the
                miseries of unwanted pregnancies and empowering women. Sanger died in 1966 at age 86, living to see the
                Supreme Court legitimize the use of contraceptives in landmark case Griswold v. Connecticut.</p>
            <h2>Life and Legacy</h2>
            <p id="tribute-info">Sanger was a profoundly influential figure of the 20th century, standing up for ideals
                like “a woman has a right to control her body; everyone should be able to decide when or whether to have
                a child; every child should be wanted and loved; and women and all people are entitled to sexual
                pleasure and fulfillment,” according to Planned Parenthood. To Sanger, birth control was the cure-all to
                all of society's ills—ending the physical and financial struggles of mothers, allowing for the
                expression of sexual love, and leading to the greater representation of women in the workplace. Through
                her relentless activism, she popularized birth control in America, her work culminating in the invention
                of the easy to use birth control pill.
